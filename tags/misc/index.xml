      <description>I wanted to find a place where I could anonymously share my musings with the rest of the world. I&amp;rsquo;m in &amp;ldquo;big tech&amp;rdquo; for almost a decade now, and have seen how most of these companies used to be to driven and innovative, only to focus more on being politically correct in recent times.
Been in crypto since 2014, even though I sodl early, but managed to make a decent comeback in 2017 and again in 2020.</description>
