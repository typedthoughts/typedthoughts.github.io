I wanted to find a place where I could anonymously share my musings with the rest of the world. I'm in "big tech" for almost a decade now, and have seen how most of these companies used to be to driven and innovative, only to focus more on being politically correct in recent times.

Been in crypto since 2014, even though I sodl early, but managed to make a decent comeback in 2017 and again in 2020. Have enough to retire comfortably, but still choose to work, mainly because I don't think I'm really that good of a trader and work is a good way to past time and socialize. Plus, it's a good cover for me as I don't really like the attention that comes with being associated with crypto.

This is not much of an intro - I don't really want to divulge too much about myself, but it was important to at least write a short post on what this space is about.
